Customer Churn Prediction using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
This project demonstrates a Machine Learning solution to predict customer churn using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) built with Python.
The model is trained on structured customer data to classify whether a customer is likely to leave a service.
